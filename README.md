# movies-app
A paired-programming project which utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap. Used glitch as a database to
store information for movies the user adds, removes, or edits. The goal of the project was to make a fetch request to the
OMBD database and have a user add their favorite movies to their list. Through this app, users were able to see
information on movies by searching titles such as the dates they were released, the poster image of the specified movie,
the actors, ratings, and directors.
